    <h1> Education for nursery and primary school children</h1>
    <p> Christ the King Nursery and Primary is located in Iceme Sub-County, Oyam District in northern Uganda. The school was established in 2018. The vision of the school is to produce pupils capable of meeting the demand for tomorrow. The pioneering enrollment for the school was 150 pupils. Today, the pupil population has increased to more than 600. Sulfur (S) is an essential plant nutrient that is important to achieving high crop yield and improved nutritional value. In recent decades, soils have become more deficient in S and the quantity of fertilizer S applied to the soil has been steadily growing. This may lead to inefficient utilization of S as a plant nutrient and have a negative footprint on the environment. A study will be conducted with the objective of estimating the sulfur use efficiency (SUE) for major cereal crops grown around the world. A three-year (2014-2016) metadata for cereal crops will be obtained from the FAO (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) website. The difference and balance methods will be used to compute the global SUE. Statistical analysis will be performed using MS Excel to obtain total area under crop production and specific area under cereals, grain yield, and total fertilizer S for all cereal crops. These will then be used to estimate SUE.
It is anticipated that SUE for cereal crops will be low due to leaching of S from the soil profile, volatilization because of SO42- reduction, residue retained S and adsorption on the exchange sites and/or chemisorption. Since the difference method accounts for S coming from the soil, this estimate of SUE is expected to be lower than that of the balance method.
As increased quantities of fertilizer S are likely to be applied to the soil to meet the ever-growing demand for food for both humans and animals, SUE may continue to further decline and this study recommends that future research actions be directed at improving SUE for cereal crops through better timing of S placement while using the right source, rate and methods.

<h1>Grid Elements</h1>

<p>A Grid Layout must have a parent element with the <em>display</em> property set to <em>grid</em> or <em>inline-grid</em>.</p>

<p>Direct child element(s) of the grid container automatically becomes grid items.</p>
